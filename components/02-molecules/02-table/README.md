# Tables

Tables carry some very simple styles just to make them feel consistent, they have a width of 100% so they fill their parent element.

There are several additional classes that can be applied & combined to tables:

* ```.table-bordered``` - apply a border to the table
* ```.table-hover``` - highlight row on hover
* ```.table-striped``` - alternating row background colors
* ```.table-headed``` - add background color to the header
