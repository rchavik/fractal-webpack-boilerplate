<h2>Templates</h2>
<p>The specific needs of all pages have been carefully considered and the appropriate components selected to deliver the content as effectively as possible.</p>
<p>We have developed the following generic 'Templates':</p>
<dl>
	<dt><strong>Default</strong></dt>
	<dd>
		<p>A page skeleton made up of all the main components that fulfil the absolute basic needs of any page on the site.</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Pages</h2>
<p>When the specific needs of a specific page can't be met by any of our generic templates, a custom 'Page' is used instead.</p>
<p>The following pages require their own bespoke 'Page':</p>
<ul>
	<li>Home</li>
</ul>
